## To-Do List Web Application with RESTful API and PostgreSQL Integration

This system enables note creation (via POST request), modification (through PUT request), and removal (via DELETE request). It ensures direct interaction and synchronization with the PostgreSQL database.

The API created serves as a bridge between the application and the database, allowing for the efficient management of note-taking functionalities such as creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
